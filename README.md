# Solving TSP using Genetic Algorithm - Sabry's Dialy Case Study
## Introduction
#### This project aims to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a Genetic Algorithm. The TSP involves finding the shortest possible route that visits a set of locations (in this case, Egyptian governorates) and returns to the starting location. We'll apply this algorithm to help Sabry's Dialy, an Egyptian YouTuber, find the closest road between Egyptian governorates for his journey.

# Case Study Background
#### Sabry's Dialy embarked on a journey to visit all the governorates of Egypt. However, due to a business trip abroad after reaching governorate 19, he needed to find the quickest route to complete his journey efficiently. He contacted us via LinkedIn, and we took on the challenge to optimize his route.

# Algorithm Overview
#### We employ a Genetic Algorithm to tackle the TSP in this project. Genetic Algorithms are a popular choice for solving combinatorial optimization problems like the TSP. They use concepts inspired by the process of natural selection to evolve a population of potential solutions over generations until an optimal or near-optimal solution is found.
